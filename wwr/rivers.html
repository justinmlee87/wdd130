                <h2>Grand Canyon Arizona</h2>
                <p>This is the grand daddy of all canyons and the grand daddy of all river trips. You will never forget your trip to the Grand Canyon. Grand Canyon river rafting provides world-class whitewater and breathtaking scenery. The canyon is not only filled with exhilerating rapids but also with side canyons and ancient indian ruins, only accessible by river rafting.</p>
                <p>Class 1-10: The Grand Canyon uses a unique river rafting scale. The rapids in the canyon are technically rated 1-10 to accomodate such a wide variety of rapids and river variances. However, most people are familiar with the regular 1-5 river rating scale, so we often refer to both.</p>

                <h2>Desolation and Gray Canyon, Utah</h2>
                <p>Winding through canyons in central Utah, in some of the most desolate land anywhere, the Green river flows towards the mighty Colorado River and the sea. High grey stone cliffs, beautiful desert scenery, and great rapids have made this run famous. This 84 mile trip runs from the Sand Wash to Swaseys Rapid (just outside Green River, Utah) and boasts outstanding scenery, interesting geologic formations, evidence of prehistoric and historic human activity, and great whitewater opportunities.</p>
                <p>Desolation is rated a class 2-3 and is usually completed in 6 days. Desolation Canyon has been recognized as a National Landmark. This designation is based on the uniqueness and rich history that the canyon tells.</p>
