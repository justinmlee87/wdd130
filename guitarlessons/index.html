                    <p>Have you heard of Jimi Hendrix? Or how about Eric Clapton? It may be hard to believe, but all the greatest guitarists had to start somewhere. Nobody is born with the knowledge of what makes up a guitar or how to properly combine notes to make a chord. Those are all techniques and knowledge learned over time and with a lot of practice. Believe it or not, anyone can become great at guitar, if you put in the time and energy. There are two important items that you must focus on if you want to become a successful guitarist.
                        First, Practice. You need to devote at least one hour, or more, each day to practice. You will not learn how to play guitar by simply wanting to or by watching a video or two. Your body must develop the familiarity and muscle memory with the movements. Failure to put in the adequate amount of time practicing each day, will result in little to no success.
                        Second, patience. To become a great guitarist, you must be patient with yourself. It takes time to develop the necessary skills. Although, some people may learn faster than others, everyone must exercise some amount of patience when learning something new. Do not get discouraged when you make mistakes. Slow it down. Understand that it will take time to get to the level of the greats.
