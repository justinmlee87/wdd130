        [Have you heard of Jimi Hendrix? Or how about Eric Clapton? It may be hard to believe, but all the greatest guitarists had to start somewhere. Nobody is born with the knowledge of what makes up a guitar or how to properly combine notes to make a chord. Those are all techniques and knowledge learned over time and with a lot of practice. Believe it or not, anyone can become great at guitar, if you put in the time and energy. There are two important items that you must focus on if you want to become a successful guitarist.
        First, Practice. You need to devote at least one hour, or more, each day to practice. You will not learn how to play guitar by simply wanting to or by watching a video or two. Your body must develop the familiarity and muscle memory with the movements. Failure to put in the adequate amount of time practicing each day, will result in little to no success.
       Second, patience. To become a great guitarist, you must be patient with yourself. It takes time to develop the necessary skills. Although, some people may learn faster than others, everyone must exercise some amount of patience when learning something new. Do not get discouraged when you make mistakes. Slow it down. Understand that it will take time to get to the level of the greats.

      <h3>[Guitar Anatomy]</h3>
      <p>
        [The guitar is made of several different components. It is important to know what these are if you want to know how to use them correctly. The Guitar Headstock is the top portion of the guitar. This is where the turning pegs and strings connect. Although there are many different shapes and sizes of Headstocks, they all function the same. This is where you will use the turning pegs to make sure each string is properly tuned, or in other words, gives the proper sound that it should. The neck of the guitar is an essential component to the sound the guitar produces. This is where you will hold down the strings to produce notes. Notice the dividers on the neck. This front part with the dividers is called the fretboard. Each section, or fret, produces a different note depending on where you hold it down.
        Give it a try!
        Also notice the circles found on some of the frets. These help you to locate the fret while playing as specific ones are marked. 
        The fretboard is numbered 1-15 (or more), starting from the headstock. 
        The last major component of the Guitar that I will cover is the Body. This is the bulk of the guitar and has several other components within it. Notice the strings end on the body. The part at which they end is called the bridge. This picture is an example of an acoustic guitar. Acoustic guitars are most recognizable because of the hole in the body. This hole creates “acoustics” and helps to accentuate the sound played by the strings. The last piece on the body I will point out is the pick guard. In this picture, it is the red, colored piece below the hole/strings. This is simply a guard against the strumming patterns and pick.]

      <h3>[Guitar Chords]</h3>
      <p>
        [What is a guitar chord? Have you heard of a music note? The sound that is created when you pluck a string is called a note. These notes change depending on the location at which you hold down the string. A guitar chord is a combination of notes and is made up of several different strings. I have often heard it said that you only need to know 3 chords to play a song! Here are a few examples of some important guitar chords you should know. Notice that they chords are named after notes. That is because they are named after the note they are derived from.]
