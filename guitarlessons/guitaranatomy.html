                        <h2>Guitar Headstock</h2>
                        <p>The Guitar Headstock is the top portion of the guitar. This is where the turning pegs and strings connect. Although there are many different shapes and sizes of Headstocks, they all function the same. This is where you will use the turning pegs to make sure each string is properly tuned, or in other words, gives the proper sound that it should.</p>

                        <h2>Guitar Neck</h2>
                        <p>The neck of the guitar is an essential component to the sound the guitar produces. This is where you will hold down the strings to produce notes. Notice the dividers on the neck. This front part with the dividers is called the fretboard. Each section, or fret, produces a different note depending on where you hold it down.
                            Give it a try!
                            Also notice the circles found on some of the frets. These help you to locate the fret while playing as specific ones are marked. 
                            The fretboard is numbered 1-15 (or more), starting from the headstock.

                        <h2>Guitar Body</h2>
                        <p>The last major component of the Guitar that I will cover is the Body. This is the bulk of the guitar and has several other components within it. Notice the strings end on the body. The part at which they end is called the bridge. This picture is an example of an acoustic guitar. Acoustic guitars are most recognizable because of the hole in the body. This hole creates “acoustics” and helps to accentuate the sound played by the strings. The last piece on the body I will point out is the pick guard. In this picture, it is the red, colored piece below the hole/strings. This is simply a guard against the strumming patterns and pick.
