                <p> What is a guitar chord? Have you heard of a music note? The sound that is created when you pluck a string is called a note. These notes change depending on the location at which you hold down the string. A guitar chord is a combination of notes and is made up of several different strings. I have often heard it said that you only need to know 3 chords to play a song! Here are a few examples of some important guitar chords you should know. Notice that they chords are named after notes. That is because they are named after the note they are derived from.
                    The numbers marked on each string indicate the finger you should use on that string. 1, should be your index finger, 2 your middle finger and 3 your ring finger. Notice on the top of each chord, there are x’s and o’s. the X means that string is muted, or in other words, should not make any sound. The O means that string can play freely when playing the chord.
